**Airbnb Analysis**


**Introduction to Airbnb Data Analysis:**

Welcome to our Airbnb data analysis project! In this analysis, we delve into a comprehensive dataset from Airbnb, a popular platform for short-term lodging rentals. Our goal is to gain insights into various aspects of the Airbnb market, including pricing dynamics, property types, neighborhood preferences, and availability trends.


**Key Technologies and Skills**
Python
Pandas
MongoDB
MYSQL 
Streamlit
Plotly

**INSTALLATIONS:**

To run this project, you need to install the following packages:

import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px
import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
import pymysql
from sqlalchemy import create_engine



**1. MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval**

To establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset, follow these steps:
Install the necessary MongoDB driver for your programming language (e.g., pymongo for Python).
Use the connection string provided by MongoDB Atlas to connect to your database from your application code.
Retrieve the Airbnb dataset using appropriate queries and data retrieval operations. 

**2. Data Cleaning and Preparation**
After retrieving the Airbnb dataset, it's essential to clean and prepare the data for further analysis. Follow these steps:

**Handle missing values:** Identify columns with missing values and decide on an appropriate strategy to handle them (e.g., imputation, removal).

**Remove duplicates:** Check for and remove duplicate entries in the dataset to ensure data integrity.

**Transform data types:** Convert data types as necessary to ensure consistency and compatibility with analysis tasks.

**Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization:** Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly and contains the necessary information for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization tasks.

**Develop the Streamlit web application:** Write the code to create an interactive web application using Streamlit. 

**Create interactive maps:** Use the geospatial data to generate interactive maps within your Streamlit application, allowing users to explore the Airbnb listings spatially.

**Test and deploy:** Test your Streamlit application locally to ensure it functions as expected. Once satisfied, deploy the application to a web server or hosting platform for public access.
