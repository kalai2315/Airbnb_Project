**Airbnb Analysis**
**1. MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval**

To establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset, follow these steps:
Install the necessary MongoDB driver for your programming language (e.g., pymongo for Python).
Use the connection string provided by MongoDB Atlas to connect to your database from your application code.
Retrieve the Airbnb dataset using appropriate queries and data retrieval operations. You may need to use aggregation pipelines or simple find queries to extract the necessary information for your analysis.

**2. Data Cleaning and Preparation**
After retrieving the Airbnb dataset, it's essential to clean and prepare the data for further analysis. Follow these steps:

**Handle missing values:** Identify columns with missing values and decide on an appropriate strategy to handle them (e.g., imputation, removal).
**Remove duplicates:** Check for and remove duplicate entries in the dataset to ensure data integrity.
**Transform data types:** Convert data types as necessary to ensure consistency and compatibility with analysis tasks.
**Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization:** Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly and contains the necessary information for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization tasks.

**3. Geospatial Visualization**
To develop a streamlit web application that utilizes geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset for interactive maps, follow these steps:

**Develop the Streamlit web application:** Write the code to create an interactive web application using Streamlit. Use libraries like Folium or Plotly to integrate geospatial data and create interactive maps.

**Incorporate geospatial data:** Retrieve relevant geospatial data from the cleaned Airbnb dataset and integrate it into your Streamlit application.

**Create interactive maps:** Use the geospatial data to generate interactive maps within your Streamlit application, allowing users to explore the Airbnb listings spatially.

**Test and deploy:** Test your Streamlit application locally to ensure it functions as expected. Once satisfied, deploy the application to a web server or hosting platform for public access.
